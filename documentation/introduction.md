Paru is a simple Ruby wrapper around [pandoc](http://www.pandoc.org), the
great multi-format document converter. Paru supports automating pandoc by
writing Ruby programs and using pandoc in your Ruby programs (see [Chapter
2](#automating-the-use-of-pandoc-with-paru)). Paru also supports writing
pandoc filters in Ruby (see [Chapter
3](#writing-and-using-pandoc-filters-with-paru)). In this manual the use of
paru is explained in detail, from explaining how to install and use paru,
creating and using filters, to putting it all together in a real-world use
case: generating this manual!

documentation](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/documentation/api-doc/).
