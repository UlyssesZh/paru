Paru is a simple Ruby wrapper around {pandoc}[http://www.pandoc.org], the
great multi-format document converter. Paru supports automating pandoc by
writing Ruby programs and using pandoc in your Ruby programs. Paru also supports writing
pandoc filters in Ruby. In the {user
manual}[https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/] the use of
paru is explained in detail, from explaining how to install and use paru,
creating and using filters, to putting it all together in a real-world use
case: generating that manual!

In this document, however, you will find the API documentation.
