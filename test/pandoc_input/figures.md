This is a test file for the filter `number_figures.rb`. That filter numbers
all figures in a file consecutively. Thus, the following four figures are
numbered 1---4:

First, ![This is the first](image.png), then ![This is the second](image.png),
followed by ![This is the third](image.png) and finally, ![This is the
fourth](image.png).

It does not matter if there is text in between or not. Although without the
newlines in between the figures they are placed on one line when converting
back to markdown again.

The fifth figure that follows is numbered correctly as well: ![This is the
fifth](image.png)
