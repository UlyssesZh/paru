# Introduction

This is a short markdown file with a number of paragraphs to test the
capitalization filter. It should capitalize the first N characters of each
paragraph that **immediately** follows a header of level 1

The idea is to reproduce the effect of starting a chapter or section with a
captitalized first line as you might see in some books. So, the previous
paragraph should be capitalized, whereas this one should not.

# Conclusion

In conclusion—note that this is again a first paragraph of a section and will
be capitalized—, a simple filter can be used to manipulate a markdown text.
