# Chapter 1

This is the content of chapter 1, to be inserted in `insert_document.md`
automatically by pandoc. Isn't that neat?

# Chapter 2

The story continues in **chapter 2**, which is also inserted

It contains multiple paragraps and a bit of code:

    echo "hello parent document!"

## And a sub section

With not much in it.

And so on.
