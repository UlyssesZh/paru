This is a test file for the filter `number_figures.rb`. That filter
numbers all figures in a file consecutively. Thus, the following four
figures are numbered 1---4:

![Figure 1. This is the first](image.png)

![Figure 2. This is the second](image.png)

![Figure 3. This is the third](image.png)

![Figure 4. This is the fourth](image.png)

It does not matter if there is text in between or not. Although without
the newlines in between the figures they are placed on one line when
converting back to markdown again.

The fifth figure that follows is numbered correctly as well:

![Figure 5. This is the fifth](image.png)
